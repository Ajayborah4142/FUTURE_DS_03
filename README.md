## üöÄ Project Title

**Students Feedback Data Analysis Using Python**

## üß© Overview

This repository contains a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline for a student feedback dataset, implemented as a Jupyter Notebook: `Students_feedback_DA.ipynb`. The notebook walks through data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, correlation checks, and visualization to help you understand which factors most influence course recommendation and student satisfaction.

> *This README was auto-generated from the notebook structure to include step-by-step instructions for running and reproducing the analysis.*

## üìÅ What‚Äôs in this repo

* `Students_feedback_DA.ipynb` ‚Äî the main Jupyter Notebook (analysis, visualizations, questions & answers).
* `README.md` ‚Äî this file (GitHub-ready, step-by-step guide).
* `requirements.txt` ‚Äî (optional) generated from detected imports below ‚Äî you can create it with the dependencies listed.

## üîé Detected notebook structure (extracted automatically)

The notebook contains the following high-level sections and checks (headings extracted):

* **Exploratory Data Analysis**

  * import Libraries
  * Load Dataset Using Pandas
  * Cheak Columns In Dataset
  * Cheak Row And Columns Available in Dataset
  * Cheak Data Structure
  * Summarize Numberical Columns
  * Cheak Correlation

* **2) Data Cleaning**

  * Handle Missing Values
  * Cheak Null Values Available In Dataset
  * Cheak Duplicates Row Available In Dataset

* Further analysis includes correlation-based Q&A sections and many analytic questions, for example:

  * Is there a strong correlation between ‚ÄúWell versed with the subject‚Äù and ‚ÄúExplains concepts in an understandable way‚Äù?
  * Does the ‚ÄúUse of presentations‚Äù impact ‚ÄúCourse recommendation based on relevance‚Äù?
  * How many students gave an overall rating above 8 (indicating high satisfaction)?
  * Top factors that most influence course recommendation

> Note: The exact notebook cell content and visualizations are present in `Students_feedback_DA.ipynb` ‚Äî open the notebook to view plots and numeric results.

## üß∞ Libraries & Requirements (inferred)

The notebook appears to import the following Python packages (used to build `requirements.txt`):

```
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- warnings
```

You can create a `requirements.txt` file with these lines (optionally adding exact versions):

```
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
warnings
```

> Tip: Replace `warnings` with `pip`'s built-in handling (no need to install `warnings` ‚Äî it's part of Python's standard library). Install precise versions if you want reproducibility, for example `pandas==2.2.3`.


## üß≠ Notebook step-by-step mapping (how to read the notebook)

This section helps reviewers and maintainers quickly navigate the notebook and find reproducible pieces.

1. **Imports & Setup** ‚Äî Import pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and configure plotting options & warnings.
2. **Load Dataset** ‚Äî Code cell that reads CSV or Excel into a DataFrame (e.g., `pd.read_csv()` or `pd.read_excel()`).
3. **Initial Checks** ‚Äî `df.head()`, `df.columns`, `df.shape`, `df.info()` to get dataset shape and types.
4. **Summary Statistics** ‚Äî `df.describe()` to inspect numerical variables.
5. **Missing Values & Duplicates** ‚Äî `df.isnull().sum()`, `df.drop_duplicates()` and handling strategies.
6. **Correlation Analysis** ‚Äî `df.corr()` and heatmaps to inspect relationships between feedback parameters.
7. **Question-driven Analysis** ‚Äî the notebook contains a list of specific analytic questions (correlations, top factors, count of high ratings) and executes the code to answer them.
8. **Visualizations** ‚Äî histograms, bar plots and correlation heatmaps showing distribution and relationships.

## üìä Key Insights (from dataset analysis)

1. **Dataset Overview**

   * Total Records: **1,001** student responses.
   * Feedback Parameters: **8 core rating columns** (plus ID fields).
   * No missing values or duplicate entries ‚Äî data is clean and ready for analysis.

2. **Average Ratings by Parameter**

   * Highest-rated aspect: **‚ÄúWell versed with the subject‚Äù** ‚Äî *average score 7.5/10*.
     ‚Üí Students perceive teachers as knowledgeable in their subjects.
   * Lowest-rated aspects:

     * **‚ÄúCourse recommendation based on relevance‚Äù** ‚Äî *avg 5.6/10*.
     * **‚ÄúSolves doubts willingly‚Äù** ‚Äî *avg 5.47/10*.
     * **‚ÄúDegree of difficulty of assignments‚Äù** ‚Äî *avg 5.43/10*.
       ‚Üí Indicates room for improvement in engagement, doubt-solving, and assignment balance.

3. **Correlation Analysis**

   * No extremely strong correlations (>0.7) detected between parameters, suggesting students rated each category independently.
   * Moderate relationships likely exist between *subject knowledge* and *clarity of explanation*.

4. **Student Satisfaction**

   * The **average overall satisfaction score** (mean of all rating parameters per student) shows that **100% of students** have an overall average rating above 8.

     > ‚ö†Ô∏è This might mean that some scores (like IDs or placeholder values) are skewing the mean ‚Äî double-check column selection for overall satisfaction metrics.

5. **Improvement Opportunities**

   * Students appreciate **teacher expertise**, but are **less satisfied with course structure and difficulty levels**.
   * Focusing on improving **assignment clarity** and **student support** may raise overall recommendation scores.

## üß© Conclusion

The analysis highlights that while students generally respect instructors‚Äô subject knowledge and teaching clarity, there‚Äôs a noticeable drop in ratings for *course relevance* and *assignment difficulty*. Strengthening the connection between course content and real-world application, and offering better support during assignments, can significantly improve satisfaction and course recommendation rates.
